	Hi there!

This is a console application Rock, Paper, Scissors.
I first did one in a programming course, but went ahead and
rewrote it and added features like "would you like to play again" etc.
This probably could be done in a better way and with less code and so forth,
but I wanted to use different methods.

The flowchart I drew before coding the app. So, this flowchart is not
by all means perfect and I think I made a lot of changes to the app while
actually coding it. But the basic structures is there, and the reason I put it
up here is to show where I'm at. Clearly I need more practice in planning the
apps but you know.
The flowchart contains the main Game, not the UserInputs or GameMethod.

	Enjoy!
